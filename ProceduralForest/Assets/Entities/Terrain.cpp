/*
 * Created as an extension of the basic terrain previously used for testing means.
 * The terrain will always be flat. We may consider adding a blocky hill somewhere later, but that is not a priority
 * The terrain will have a randomly placed dirt road that will go from the camera starting point 0,0,0 and end at a random
 * point.
 *
 * The terrain will also choose from a selection of textures to use as its main grass texture for the rest of the forest.
